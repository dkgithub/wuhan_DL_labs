We have provided a few notebooks

* If you are not familiar with Pandas start with Intro_Pandas.ipynb
* The tutorial starts with TopTagging_1.ipynb and continues in TopTagging_2.ipynb

Do not worry, if you do not get to the end of the last notebook. 
But you should worry, if you get to the end of the last notebook before the time is over. 
The aim is to learn by experimenting with the given examples!


Have fun!
