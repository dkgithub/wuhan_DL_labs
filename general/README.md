We have provided a few notebooks

* If you are not familiar with Jupyter start with IPython_and_Jupyter.ipynb
* If you are not familiar with NumPy spent 15 min on Intro_Numpy.ipynb
* If you are not familiar with Matplotlib, just do not try to understand deeply the part of 
  the notebooks where plots are created. Although, here is a Matplotlib cheat sheet included Matplotlib_Cheatsheet.ipynb
* The tutorial starts with Intro_DL_with_Keras_1.ipynb and continues in Intro_DL_with_Keras_1.ipynb

Do not worry, if you do not get to the end of the last notebook. 
But you should worry, if you get to the end of the last notebook before the time is over. 
The aim is to learn by experimenting with the given examples!


Have fun!
